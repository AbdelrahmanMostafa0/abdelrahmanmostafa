# 💻 Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio!  
This project is a playful, interactive desktop-like experience built with **Next.js** and **Framer Motion**. I wanted to move away from the usual "scroll-and-read" sites and make something that feels alive and fun to explore — just like cracking open an old OS.

## ✨ Features

- 🖥️ **Desktop UI Experience**

  - Every section (About, Work, Contact, Links) behaves like a draggable window.
  - Windows can be opened, closed, stacked, and moved freely — just like a desktop OS.
  - Multiple windows can be opened at once for full chaos mode.

- 📱 **Mobile-first Custom Behavior**

  - Mobile view uses a different layout:  
    Clicking a section opens a fullscreen drawer-style modal from the bottom.
  - Only one window can be open at a time on mobile to keep the UI clean and practical.

- ⚡ **Animations with Framer Motion**

  - Smooth transitions between states.
  - Dragging, opening, and closing windows feels fluid and snappy.

- 🌙 **Dark Mode Toggle**
  - Easy on the eyes with a theme switcher in the corner.
